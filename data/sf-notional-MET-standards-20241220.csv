Additionally, the software is incapable of handling complex scenarios involving multiple simultaneous threats, such as coordinated satellite maneuvers by adversaries. The limited processing speed often causes latency during training, which undermines the confidence of operators in their ability to handle live missions.

Additionally, the lack of an adaptive user interface and outdated scenario databases prevents personnel from experiencing realistic training environments.
